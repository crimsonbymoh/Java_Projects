Array is a collection of elements of same type. For example an int array contains integer elements and a String array contains String elements. The elements of Array are stored in contiguous locations in the memory.

This is how an array looks like:

int number[] = new int[10]

Here number is the array name. The type of the array is integer, which means it can store integer values. The size of the array is 10.

Array works on an index-based system. In the above array, number[0] represents the first element of the array, number[1] represents the second element of the array and so on. The index of array starts from 0 and ends at array_size-1. In the above example, the index of first element is 0 and index of 10th element is 9.

Declaration, Instantiation and Initialization of Array in Java

This is how we declare, instantiate and initialize an array.

int number[]; //array declaration
number[] = new int[10]; //array instantiation
number[0] = 10; //array Initialization
number[1] = 20; //array Initialization


Access the element in an Array

public class JavaExample{
  public static void main(String args[]){
    //array declaration, instantiation and initialization
    int number[] = new int[10]; //array instantiation

    //print array elements
    //length property return the size of the array
    for(int i=0;i<number.length;i++)
      System.out.println(number[i]);
  }
}
